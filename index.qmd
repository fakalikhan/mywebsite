My name is Faraz Ali, and I am an aspiring financial analyst with a robust background in finance, economics, and data science. I aim to leverage my analytical skills and industry knowledge to contribute to the growth and success of a leading financial services firm. My goal is to secure a challenging position that allows me to apply my expertise in financial modeling, portfolio management, and equity research, ultimately progressing towards a strategic leadership role in the industry.

I hold a B.Sc. in Economics and Finance from the Institute of Business Management and am currently pursuing an M.Sc. in International Business Administration with a concentration in Finance, Accounting, and Data Science from the European University Viadrina. Additionally, I have passed the CFA Level 1 exam with a performance in the 90th percentile.

My professional experience includes roles as a Trainee Research Analyst at Aba Ali Habib Securities, where I developed financial models and market analysis reports, an Equity Research Intern at Al Habib Capital Markets, and a Sales & Trading Intern at Next Capital Limited. I have also achieved notable success in the CFA Institute Research Challenge, ranking in the top 5 nationally. Through these roles, I have honed my skills in financial analysis, portfolio management, and client engagement.
